Account-based marketing has become a lot more sophisticated in the last few years.

New technology has enabled marketers to target leads in new ways. At Albacross, we’re incredibly proud of our ad platform, which gives you the power to directly target your leads with personalised ads.

The platform works on a pay-as-you-go model, so there are no hidden costs. It also integrates seamlessly with our lead generation tool.

In this short post, we want to show you exactly how to get started. Let’s dive in.

## 1. Pick your targets

The first step is to put together your *Company target list* from either the *New Campaign* or *Track* dashboard.There are three ways of doing this - search our databases, identify your site’s traffic or upload your own list - and you can find full instructions about finding and filtering new leads in earlier posts (see the links at the bottom of the article).

Once you’ve decided on who you want to advertise to, all you need to do is hit the *Add* button for each of you preferred leads. Then check your *Company target list* to make sure all the companies you want to target are included.

If you want to advertise to *one* company, just make sure it’s the only entry on your target list. In the screenshot below, you can see we’ve chosen to target Albacross (we’re an easy sell).

If you want to run numerous campaigns for different groups of leads then you will need to do it sequentially. Compile your first target list, complete the steps below, and then repeat the process for each separate group.

Hit the *Next* tab to move onto the second step.

## 2. Select *Brand Awareness* or *Traffic*

You have two options for your campaign. You can either build brand awareness or drive traffic directly to your website.

Albacross will optimize ad spend and ad positions depending on which you pick. For most people, “Drive Traffic” is the best option. If, on the other hand, you want to introduce your brand to a lead before reaching out to them directly, then opt for “Increase Brand Awareness”.

In either case, you will be asked to pick your landing page URL. This is the page visitors will land on when they click your ad.

## 3. Choose your budget

There are a few options for picking your budget. You will need to set three things: your daily spend, the length of your campaign and the start date. We’ll also predict your campaign’s efficiency based on your inputs.

## 4. Upload ads

You’re nearly finished!

The penultimate step is to start uploading ads.

You have two options. The first is to let us automatically make your ads for you. All you need to do is upload a logo and come up with a headline and a few lines of copy.

Once you’ve done that, select which banner sizes you would like to display.

Check the [*Specifications* page](https://albacross.com/specifications/) to see which formats are best-suited to the countries in which your leads are located.

Alternatively, you can upload your own ads, either as an image or HTML5 file. Again, you’ll want to check which ad formats to use.

## 5. Make a payment

The last thing to do is make a payment. Click *Next* and you will be taken to the payments page. Fill out your details and confirm. You’re ready to go!

## What’s next?

Once you’ve set up your first campaign, it’s time to track the results. In the next article in this series, we’ll show you how to make the most of your analytics dashboard. We’ll also introduce you to some more advanced tips for pinpointing red-hot leads.
